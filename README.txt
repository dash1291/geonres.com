Geonres.com is an idea of geographical dicovery of music. It is a mashup of Last.fm, YouTube, Google Maps and Yahoo Placemaker APIs. 

It uses geonres-bot at its backend which runs a daemon to populate a database of artists found on Last.fm and their geographical location extracted using Yahoo Placemaker API.

Boilerplate2 is used to give it HTML5 default, not properly tweaked. Overriden CSS in the css/style.css
